#My Job Search

My job search is a simple web-scraping application that scans Indeed, FlexJobs, and SimplyHired for job postings, and returns the results merged into one set of job postings. The web-scraping portion was coded with Cheerio and Node.js, and the front-end was coded with React. A public API for this application is also available.
